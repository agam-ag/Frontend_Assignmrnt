My Approach
1. Login Page
Created a basic login form with name and email fields.

On form submission, data is stored in localStorage and accessed throughout the app using Context API.

2. Sidebar & Routing
Sidebar is fixed on desktop and slides in/out on mobile.

Used NavLink from React Router to highlight the active page with a yellow background.

Hamburger icon is displayed on small screens for toggling the sidebar.

3. Dashboard UI
Designed as per the given mock using Tailwind CSS utilities.

Includes stat cards, topbar, and a responsive layout.

4. User List Page
Data is fetched from a local users.json file.

Displayed using a responsive table with columns: Name, Email, Role, Status.

Status (Active/Inactive) is color-coded using Tailwind badge styling.

Export button is a placeholder for future enhancement.

Deployment: I have deployed this on vercel.
